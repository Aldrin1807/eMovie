# Overview
E-Movie is an online platform hosted on Azure, with the database also hosted on Azure. The primary focus of the project was to understand the logic and functionality of MVC, with less emphasis on frontend design.

The website caters to two types of users: simple users and admins. Simple users can browse and search for movies, view movie details, order tickets, and add items to their cart. The movies are associated with a producer, cinema, and a list of actors. For payment simulation, PayPal Sandbox integration is utilized.

Admin users have additional privileges and can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on all entities, and also has a section to see the orders that are made and a table of registered users.

To access the admin functionality, use the following credentials:

- Email: aldrin@gmail.com
- Password: Aldrin_123


To use the website as a regular user, please create a new account. The project focuses on implementing MVC logic and functionality, so the frontend design may be minimal.
